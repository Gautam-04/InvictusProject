## Problem Statement
```PS2: Revolutionizing Research Collaboration and Discovery```  
Research is fragmented and inefficient. Researchers face challenges in:

- Finding Relevant articles across multiple sources.
- Accessing multiple datasets.
- Managing citing literature and other workflows separately.
- Collaborating effectively with peers and experts.
- Gaining visibility in an overwhelming sea of publications.

Keeping these challenges in mind, we aim to solve this problem statement.
